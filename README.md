# Euterpe

[![Build Status](https://github.com/SquidSinker/Euterpe.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/SquidSinker/Euterpe.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

Euterpe.jl is a ground-up synthesiser, written in native Julia. This project is a heavy work in progress. Future plans include a suite of effects. THis package uses the high quality Julia packages for FFTs and DiffEqs, making this a perfect language to experiment with instrument simulation as an alternative to sampling. Much of this is yet to come, so watch this space.

### JuliaCon Presentation. 
This project was the subject of a talk at JuliaCon 2023 at Cambridge. The presentation for the talk is available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14sARbTRDWW5orESvp2wCKN3bPiEdTwbn. Also present in that folder are the sound sample files that are mentioned in that talk. 

### The name

The package is named after the muse presiding over music from Greek mythology.
